(C) 2024 by [Damir Cavar], [Billy Dickson], [Koushik Reddy Parukola], [NLP-Lab]


Natural Language Qu Kit (NLQK) is a toolkit for Quantum Natural Language Processing (Q-NLP).

This is an [Natural Language Processing Lab] project.

What is the goal of this project?

The goals are to provide a library and programming environment for Natural Language Processing using a hybrid environment of classical and quantum computers. NLP tools and libraries are excellent environments for education or deployed NLP applications:

- [Natural Language Processing Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)

There are some excellent Q-NLP libraries and tools as for example:

- [lambeq](https://github.com/CQCL/lambeq)

We aim at expanding these development environments (classical and quantum) to facilitate Quantum NLP engineering.
